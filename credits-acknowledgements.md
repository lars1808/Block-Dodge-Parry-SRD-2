# Credits & Acknowledgements

Special thanks to the following creators for all the amazing work that this document is built upon:

- **Yochai Gal** for *Cairn*, the amazing game that makes *Block, Dodge, Parry* possible. This book makes extensive use of the SRD of Cairn and is highly compatible with all Cairn-related creations. The first version of *Block, Dodge, Parry* was a branching-off/expansion of *Cairn*, and version 2 can be considered the same for *Cairn 2e*.
- **Chris McDowall** for *Into The Odd*, *Electric Bastionland*, and all further branches of the *Mark of the Odd*.
- **Arnold Kemp** for the GLOG system. Its magic system formed the basis for the one featured in *Block, Dodge, Parry.*
- **Simon Washbourne** for *Barbarians of Lemuria*. The career system provided a big source of inspiration.
- **Emmy Allen** of *Cavegirl’s Game Stuff* for the rock-paper-scissors implementation of dueling, found in the Social Conflict section.
- *Errant* by **Ava Islam**/Kill Jester Publishing, LLP, provided many brilliant procedures for OSR play. *Block, Dodge, Parry* in particular uses the *Fantasy Species*, *Gambit,* and *Initiative* procedures, and builds upon them.
- *Downtime in Zyan* by **Ben Laurence** was a major inspiration for *Complex Tasks.*
- The idea of “*counter Gambits*” was a great addition by **NekuZ** in the *Block, Dodge, Parry* Discord.
- The descriptors used in *Practical Magic* are inspired by *The Electrum Archive* by **Emiel Boven**.
- Further thanks to all of the amazing players who have always indulged me in my wild new systems and experiments: Bas, Dick, Hans, Cindy, Mykola, and many more.
- Special thanks to the **Block, Dodge, Parry Discord server** for their feedback and ideas.
- Shout-out to the amazing **NSR-Cauldron, Prismatic Waystation**, and **Cairn** Discord servers, and all the amazing people there who have always been so helpful with feedback and ideas.
- Aya for the candlelight, literally and metaphorically.
