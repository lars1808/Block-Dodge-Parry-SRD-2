# Running Adventures

Adventures tend to center around three types of locations:

- Towns (villages, cities, sanctuaries): Pockets of so-called civilization, where players can stock up, gather information, and recover.
- Wilderness (forests, mountains, deserts, oceans): The vast lands between Points of Interest, offering exploration, wonders, and dangers.
- Dungeons (literal dungeons, ruins, castles, caves or basically any dense/dangerous location): Treacherous locales with both treasures and monsters.

Adventures often cycle between these points: Start in a town, learn of a rumor, head through the wilderness to the next town to investigate, traverse more nature to locate old ruins, delve and explore, and try to make it back to town in one piece.

There are many great resources to help you flesh out actual towns, wildernesses (hexes), and dungeons. This chapter is not about how to create such locations but about how these locales interact with *Block, Dodge, Parry* specifically.
