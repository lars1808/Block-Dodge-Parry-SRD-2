# Character Creation
1. TOC
{:toc}

## Name, Careers, Backgrounds

First, players pick their PC’s **name**, **pronouns**, **appearance**, and other such details. Next, they make up to **4 Career choices**. A PC’s career informs their potential knowledge and skills. See [Careers & Skills](/careers-skills).

## Ability Scores

Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes: **Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**. When creating a PC, the players roll **3d6** for each of their character’s ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

A value of 6 or lower makes a character *weak* in that ability, a value of 15 or higher *strong*. This can come into play within the fiction of the adventure. (It does not affect their abilities in combat.) The following descriptions can be used for characters with scores of 6 or lower, or 15 or higher:

| **Ability** | **6 or lower** | **15 or higher** |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| STR         | Frail          | Tough            |
| DEX         | Clumsy         | Deft             |
| WIL         | Undisciplined  | Resolute         |

### Optional Rule: Luck

Luck is an optional fourth Ability. A character starts with 10 Luck. Whenever you would otherwise roll a Die of Fate (d6) to determine an outcome or situation, the player rolls a d20 instead.

- If they roll **under their Luck**, the situation favors them. For example: There is in fact a bale of hay under the window they are planning to jump out of. Gaining a favorable outcome in this way “burns” 1 Luck point — permanently.
- If they roll **equal to their Luck**, they gain a favorable outcome and gain 1 Luck, as well. This is the only way to regain Luck.
- If they roll **above their Luck**, the situation is unfavorable. This might mean there’s no bale of hay, or even that there’s a patch of brambles instead.

Luck can also be used to enhance Saves, after they’ve been rolled. If a PC makes a STR Save with a STR of 8 and they roll a 12, failing the Save, they can ‘burn’ 4 Luck to reduce their roll and instead succeed. Luck is intended to slowly run out over the course of a PC’s adventures. Choosing to use Luck should be an interesting dramatic choice.

### Optional Rule: Age & Experience

Let players pick or roll for the starting age of their characters, which affects the number of their past careers and their Abilities. **Strength** is at its peak during their physical prime. **Dexterity** lessens over time, as one gets older and stiffer. **Willpower** increases as the mind fortifies itself over a long life.

| **1d6** | **Age & Experience**                                         | **Effect on STR** | **Effect on DEX** | **Effect on WIL** |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 1       | **Young**: Barely not a teenager anymore. 1 Career Skill. Age: 17+1d6. | -1                | +2                | -2                |
| 2       | **Emerging**: You’re starting to learn the ropes. Lowest of 2d4 Career Skills. Age: 23+1d10 | 0                 | +1                | -1                |
| 3-4     | **Prime**: You’re in your prime. 1d4 Career Skills. Age: 33+1d10 | +1                | 0                 | 0                 |
| 5       | **Wizened**: You’re getting up there. Highest of 2d4 Career Skills. Age: 43+1d10 | 0                 | -1                | +1                |
| 6       | **Old**: You’ve been around. 4 Career Skills. 53+1d10        | -1                | -2                | +2                |

## Hit Protection

Roll 1d6 to determine PC’s starting Hit Protection (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a character’s health or fortitude. Damage that cannot be guarded against (from unseen sources, or hazards such as falls, fire, or gas) bypass HP. Resting for a few moments, catching one’s breath, and having a drink of water restores lost HP. (For more, see [Healing & Recovery](/rules#healing--recovery).)

## Fantasy Species

If desired, players can pick one of the following attributes, to play as a fantasy species of their choice.

- **Tough** (dwarves, orcs, etc.) — Once per day, when you would be reduced to 0 hp, you may choose to be reduced to 1 hp instead.
- **Arcane** (elves, demons, etc.) — Once per day, you can attempt to perform a minor magical feat related to your ancestry: Describe what you would like to happen. The Warden will decide if any Ability Saves need to be made.
- **Cunning** (halflings, goblins, etc.) — Once per day, you may reroll any saving throw.
- **Adaptable** (humans, half-humans, etc.) — Once per day, you may choose to use a different Ability for a Save, instead of the one the Warden asks for.

## Inventory

A character's inventory represents both their literal equipment, as well as a “stamina bar” of sorts, through *Fatigue* (See [Deprivation & Fatigue](/rules#deprivation--fatigue)).

Characters have **10 inventory slots** in total. Unless noted otherwise, items take up **one slot**. Small items can be bundled together. **Bulky items** take up **two slots** and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry.

Items in inventory are either **equipped** (when in active use) or **stored** (efficiently tucked away in a backpack or on their person).

Any character with **all inventory slots filled** (by gear or Fatigue) is reduced to 0 HP, as they cannot effectively defend themselves.

## Preferred Weapon

When creating a character, the player chooses one **Damage Type Proficiency** (bludgeoning, piercing, slashing) to be proficient in. This means they gain the benefits that the damage type gives, such as bludgeoning ignoring 1 Armor (see [Weapon Skills](/weapons-armor-gear#weapon-skills)). They also choose one weapon to gain **Weapon Skill Proficiency** in, meaning they can use the weapon’s tag (Bleed, Brutal, Shock) right away. They can also add this weapon to their inventory.

## Starting Gear

New player characters start with the following. See [Weapons, Armor & Gear](/weapons-armor-gear) for more information.

- Three days' rations (1 slot)
- A waterskin (Usage die of 8)
- A torch
- A flint and steel (weightless)
- A backpack
- A trinket of one of their past careers
- 3d6 coins
- One false and one true rumor about the region
- Weapon and armor: pick one
  - Light armor (1 Armor) and 2 Fast (d6) weapons
  - A shield (1 Armor) and a Balanced (d8) weapon
  - Medium Armor (2 Armor, Bulky) and a Slow (d10) weapon
