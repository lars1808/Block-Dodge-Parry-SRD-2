# Careers & Skills
1. TOC
{:toc}

  **At Character Creation**, players choose **up to four previous careers**. Choosing a career means a character spent at least *some* time in this capacity. Maybe it was their actual job, maybe a side gig, maybe a personal interest. A career can **be chosen multiple times**. Every time a career is chosen, choose a single **skill** from this career and add it to the character.

**Example 1: Fiction to Career to Skills**

> *Halsted wants to play a* **Noble** *turned* **Destitute** *turned* **Mercenary.** *He decides to pick* **Noble** *twice. He can now pick 2 Noble skills, 1 Destitute skill, and 1 Mercenary skill. He chooses to be a Provocateur Socialite (both Noble skills) with Friends in Low Places (Destitute) who has quite a bit of Bloodlust (Mercenary Skill).*

**Example 2: Skills to Career to Fiction**

> *Jace wants to play as a paladin-type character. He picks Devotion (***Priest***) twice, Inspiring (***Soldier***), and Brutal Blows (***Mercenary***). With the prompts of Priest, Soldier, Mercenary, he builds a story about being a soldier, being dishonorably discharged, then spending time as a mercenary before converting to faith to repent for his sins, as a priest.*

## Common Knowledge

Each career has **common knowledge**. This means that players can ask questions to the Warden about **what their character would know**. For example, a mercenary may ask, *“What is the weak point in the enemy fortification?”* The answer could be, “*The second-floor windows* *are a structural weak spot; you reckon proper leverage would do the trick.”* This can start an effort to acquire said leverage and reach the second floor. The answer is not a magic solution to the problem.

Note that Common Knowledge is about **prompts** and is not a substitute for **Time, Gear, and Skill**. A thief might ask, *“What would be the best way to obtain the key to the tower off the warden?”* The Warden might respond with, *“You figure that pickpocketing it off of him during the Sunday market would be a good approach.”* This still requires the thief to be skilled in pickpocketing and have, say, a sharp purse-cutting knife to pull off the theft.

## How Skills Work

Some skills are specifically bound to certain situations or are used exclusively in combat. For the skills that are more broad, such as social or knowledge skills, note that skills work in tandem with the **Time, Gear, Skill** framework. Having a skill might provide an edge and remove the need for a roll, but *not* having the skill does not prohibit any specific actions. Picking a skill *does* mean the character is outstanding in that aspect.

> Grun is a former Thief (Career choice) from the city of Strov. When trying to locate the black market of Strov, Anna, who is playing Grun, can invoke the Thief background here: It is logical to assume that Grun has connections there. The difference from the *Friends in Low Places* skill is that the skill would help in *every city ever*. You could still argue that the Thief background would still help with that, and I probably wouldn’t rule against it. **Roll with players who utilize their background, careers and skills, and keep the game going.**

## Available Careers

The careers written here (and the associated skills) should fit most fantasy settings. Consider making your own to fit your setting; perhaps you do not have soldiers and mercenaries, but knights (who are part noblemen) and bandits (who have access to more dirty tricks).
